# Pipelines for General Classification using Scikit-learn

This repository provides examples of building classification pipelines using Scikit-learn.  It demonstrates how to streamline the process of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and model training within a unified pipeline structure.  This approach enhances code organization, reproducibility, and maintainability.

## Overview

Scikit-learn pipelines are a powerful tool for creating machine learning workflows.  They allow you to chain together multiple steps, such as data scaling, feature selection, and model training, into a single pipeline object.  This makes your code cleaner, easier to understand, and less prone to errors.  It also simplifies model tuning and cross-validation.

This repository provides examples of various classification pipelines, showcasing different preprocessing techniques, feature engineering methods, and classification algorithms.

## Features

* **Data Preprocessing:** Demonstrates various preprocessing techniques (e.g., standardization, normalization, imputation).
* **Feature Engineering:**  *(If implemented)*  Includes examples of feature engineering within the pipeline.
* **Model Selection:** Showcases different classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests).
* **Pipeline Construction:**  Provides clear examples of how to construct and use Scikit-learn pipelines.
* **Model Training and Evaluation:**  Includes scripts for training and evaluating the pipelines using appropriate metrics.
* **Cross-validation:**  *(If implemented)*  Demonstrates how to use cross-validation with pipelines for robust model evaluation.
* **Grid Search/Randomized Search:** *(If implemented)* Shows how to use grid search or randomized search to optimize pipeline hyperparameters.
* **[Other Features]:** List any other relevant features.
